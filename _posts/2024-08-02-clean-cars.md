In our [recent article](https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/news-insights/will-americas-clean-car-policies-persist/), "Will America’s Clean Car Policies Persist?" for the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, my co-author and I looked at the ambitious path the United States is taking towards a zero-emission automotive future. We highlighted how the nation’s four cornerstone clean car policies – EPA regulations, California's Advanced Clean Cars II, and federal tax credits – are accelarating the shift towards electric vehicles (EVs). However, during my research, it became clear that such policies will likley face a range of challenges, from legal, to political and economic.

While the article mainly focuses on U.S. policies under the Biden Administration, it’s essential to consider the global context. Many countries are also aggressively pursuing clean car policies. The European Union, for instance, has set targets for reducing CO2 emissions from new cars and vans, effectively pushing automakers towards electrification. China, the world's largest auto market, is heavily investing in EV technology and infrastructure, with its government offering substantial subsidies and incentives.

A comparative analysis reveals both commonalities and divergences in these global efforts. Most countries recognize the need of transitioning to cleaner transportation to mitigate climate change and improve air quality. However, the pace and intensity of these policies vary widely. Factors like economic conditions, energy resources, and political landscape influence the approach taken by different nations.

Returning to the U.S., the legal and political battles over clean car policies are far from over. The fossil fuel industry and its allies are mounting a formidable opposition, challenging these policies in court and lobbying for rollbacks. The outcome of these legal challenges and the 2024 presidential election will significantly impact the trajectory of the U.S. clean car agenda.

Furthermore, the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits have introduced new complexities. While designed to boost domestic EV production and supply chain development, the policy has faced criticism for its protectionist nature and potential to distort the global EV market.

Despite these challenges, the overall trend towards electrification is undeniable. Automakers are investing billions of dollars in EV development and production, and consumers are increasingly embracing electric vehicles. However, a successful transition to a clean car future requires a coordinated effort involving governments, industry, and consumers.

To accelerate the adoption of EVs, several key areas demand attention:

- Infrastructure: Expanding the charging network is crucial to address range anxiety and make EVs more convenient for consumers.
- Affordability: Reducing the upfront cost of EVs through incentives and technological advancements is essential to make them accessible to a wider audience.
- Battery technology: Continued research and development are needed to improve battery performance, reduce costs, and increase sustainability.
- Grid integration: Ensuring the power grid can accommodate the increased demand from EV charging is vital to avoid strain and blackouts.

The future of clean car policies is uncertain, but the potential benefits are immense. By overcoming the challenges and seizing the opportunities, the United States and other countries can pave the way for a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable transportation sector.
