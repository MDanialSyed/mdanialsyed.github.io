I'm an experienced quantitative researcher and data strategist with a background in machine learning, environment, and energy economics. I graduated from Emory University, USA, with a B.A. in economics and later obtained my M.Sc. in economics from Universit√§t Bonn in Germany, where I specialized heavily in the applications of machine learning to very large and complex datasets under the mentorship of Prof. Philipp Eisenhauer and Prof. Christoph Breunig.

I'm passionate about leveraging existing state-of-the-art machine learning methods to study the impact of environmental policy and to spur the clean energy transition in emerging economies. At Wharton School, I was in-charge of developing a data package for evaluating the impact of land protection policies in the EU. Before that, I also worked at the United Nations University - Institute of Environment & Human Security, where I led the successful development of a sophisticated ML model to better understand the different mindsets regarding urban sustainability transformation in Latin America. Through these experiences, I have gained a multi-level skillset in utilizing cutting-edge computational techniques and a dedication to advancing sustainability and impactful economic research.

On this website, you will find details about my projects, publications, and experiences in using data to innovate and strategize for the betterment of humankind. I'm always open to working with others in industry, goverment, and academia that share with my vision - in case you're interested, please feel free to contact me to discuss potential collaborations.
